The NaRIBaS scripts are in the DFT folder.

They are executed with commands:
./naribas STEP1-optimization.sh
./naribas STEP2-single_point.sh
./naribas STEP3-database.sh

NB! Orca program directory needs to be specified in the STEPs, else jobs will not run.

Each step has an associated task file in DFT folder:
The first STEP is responsible for the geometry optimization of ionic pairs.
The second steps conducts single point calculations with three different methods.
The third step indexes some properties of interest in a json format database file.

The input lists are in DFT/inputlists folder.
The calculation template input file and starting geometries are in DFT/sysprep.
DFT/source folder contains the sourcecode for NaRIBaS

And finally, the results are saved in Experiments_DFT folder.
Example calculation results and database are attached as an archive.
